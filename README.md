## ðŸ§® Scoring Algorithm

**Total Score = Rule-Based (50pts) + AI Analysis (50pts)**

### Rule-Based Scoring (0-50 points)

| Factor | Points | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Role** | 20 | Decision Maker (CEO, VP, Director) |
| | 10 | Influencer (Manager, Senior, Lead) |
| | 0 | Other roles |
| **Industry** | 20 | Exact ICP match |
| | 10 | Adjacent industry |
| | 0 | No match |
| **Completeness** | 10 | Based on filled fields (6 total) |

### AI Scoring (0-50 points)

**GPT-4o Chain of Thought Analysis:**
1. Decision authority assessment
2. Company-offer fit evaluation
3. Pain point alignment
4. Buying signals detection
5. Risk factor identification

**Score Calculation:**
- High Intent: 50pts Ã— confidence
- Medium Intent: 30pts Ã— confidence  
- Low Intent: 10pts Ã— confidence

**Final Intent:** High (â‰¥70) | Medium (40-69) | Low (<40)
